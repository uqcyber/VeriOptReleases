An @{typ IRGraph} can be treated as an instantiation of
various type classes such as the equal type class.

Here we define the instantiations for all type classes
of which @{typ IRGraph} belongs.

subsection \<open>Equal Instance\<close>

The following is an incorrect definition of equality
which is used to allow code generation of the Canonicalization
phase. Without this we have to use the values command to generate
all possible results of the canonicalization phase.

Note that we should be able to find a correct equality definition
in terms of the ids, kind, and stamp function. However, we are
yet to find a satisfactory definition as yet.
