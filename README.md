# Veriopt

[![Build](https://github.com/uqcyber/veriopt-releases/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uqcyber/veriopt-releases/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Veriopt is a formal verification effort undertaken by researchers at the University of Queensland. The project aims to formally verify the optimization phases within the [GraalVM](http://graalvm.org/) compiler.

The intermediate representation of the compiler is formalized within the [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) interactive theorem prover. Optimizations are then proven to be semantic preserving transformations of the intermediate representation.

This repository hosts the [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) theories which define a formal semantics of the intermediate representation and prove the correctness of optimization phases. The repository is in a pre-release state as we develop the theory, the theories including the formal semantics may change frequently.

## Viewing Theories
The theories developed as part of this project are automatically built as HTML and deployed for viewing at the below URL:

https://uqcyber.github.io/veriopt-releases

This page provides an overview for each of the Isabelle sessions. You can navigate the theories through the links on the index page. Documentation in the form of PDFs for all relevant theories can also be found at the following locations:

Full document: https://uqcyber.github.io/veriopt-releases/Document/document.pdf

Outline, ignoring proof details: https://uqcyber.github.io/veriopt-releases/Document/outline.pdf

## Editing Theories
Theories can be modified within the Isabelle/HOL IDE using the following command. Isabelle2022 will need to be installed and the tool wrapper should be accessible via the `isabelle` command on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uqcyber/veriopt-releases
isabelle jedit -d veriopt-releases ROOT
```

## Building Theories
Building the theories will check all the theories in the repository are correct and generate HTML and PDF outputs. You can build the theories with the following command. Isabelle2022 will need to be installed and the tool wrapper should be accessible via the `isabelle` command on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uqcyber/veriopt-releases
cd veriopt-releases
isabelle build -P. -D . -v
```

Generated HTML and PDF artifacts will be available in the `veriopt` directory within the repository.
